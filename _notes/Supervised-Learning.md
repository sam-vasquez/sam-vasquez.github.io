Supervised learning is a method of [[Machine Learning]] in which the ML model is trained to fit a function to a finite set of pre-prepared labeled data such that it can output appropriate labels for general arbitrary data.

The models generally start with a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(\vec{x}, \vec{y})\}$, where $\vec{x}$ is a set of data points, and $y_i$ is the label corresponding to the data point $x_i$.

There are very many different supervised learning techniques, depending on what the data looks like and how the data is labeled.

Some examples include:
- [[Linear Regression]]
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- [[k-Nearest Neighbors]]
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
