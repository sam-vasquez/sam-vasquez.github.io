title: "k-local Hamiltonian"

A Hamiltonian is said to be *k-local* when it can be represented as a sum
$$
H = \sum_i^{N} T_i,
$$
with at most $k$ physical subsystems participating in each interaction term $T_i$.

The interaction strength of a physical subsystem $s$ in a $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ is given by the sum $\sum_i ||T_i||$ of operator norms over those interaction terms $T_i$ in which the physical subsystem $s$ participates.

A family of $k$-local Hamiltonians is called *$J$-bounded* if, for every Hamiltonian $H_N$ in the family, the largest interaction strength among the physical subsystems involved is no greater than $J$. 

A family of Hamiltonians is $D$-dimensional if the physical subsystems involved can be arranged into a $D$-dimensional square lattice, such that all interaction terms are kept geometrically local.
