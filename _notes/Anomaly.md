An anomaly is a failure of a particular symmetry of the classical action to be preserved in the quantum action. In particular, the anomalous symmetry is a symmetry of the action, but not of the path integral measure.

The simplest and first discovered example is the [[Chiral Anomaly]].

I believe there was a problem about anomalies from pion decays back in NPP?
