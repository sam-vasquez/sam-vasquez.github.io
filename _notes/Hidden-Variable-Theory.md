Hidden-variable theory is a model that proposes that there exists a deterministic explanation of quantum mechanical measurements, explained by an underlying variable that describes quantum states and makes properties intrinsic.

Ideally, a hidden-variable theory of quantum mechanics would preserve locality.
However, [[Bell's Theorem]] has proved that there does not exist any local
hidden-variable theory that is consistent with quantum measurement.

See Kochen-Specker / Bell-KS theorem for additional constraints on non-local hidden-variable theories.
