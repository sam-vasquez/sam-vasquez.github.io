Example of a [[QCD EFT]] for interacting fermions with chiral symmetry.
Inspired by [[BCS Theory]]
Models [[Chiral Symmetry Breaking]]
No quark confinement
Not renormalizable

In 1+1 dimensions, has been simulated on quantum computers, see [[(2022) Quantum simulation of chiral phase transitions]]  and [[(2022) Studying chirality imbalance with quantum algorithms]]
