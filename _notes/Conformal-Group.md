The conformal group is the group of coordinate transformations that preserve
angles. This includes translations, Lorentz transformations, and rescalings.
Notably, this makes the [[Poincare Group|Poincare group]] a subgroup of the conformal group. 

We can define the conformal group by considering transformations $x\rightarrow x'$ that leave the Minkowski metric unchanged up to an overall position dependent rescaling:

$$
\eta_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow \Omega^2(x) \eta_{\mu\nu}
.$$
