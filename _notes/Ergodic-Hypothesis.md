Basic postulate of stat mech:
All microstates consistent with macrovariables $N,V,E$ are equally likely. 
Equilibrium stat mech is ergodic. Consider an ensemble of $\Omega$ systems with identical macroscopic properties. 
An ensemble average of some observable is $\langle G \rangle = \frac{1}{\Omega} \sum_i G_i$. 
The ergodic principle is that the time average is equal to the ensemble average. So that's to say that over time, a system will effectively explore all configurations in the ensemble.

(Look up eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. related to random matrix theory.)
