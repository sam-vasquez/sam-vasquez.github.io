The microcanonial ensemble is a choice of [[Ensemble]] fundamental to statistical mechanics. It is assumed that the phase space of large systems is [[Ergodic System|ergodic]], and hence that every phase space configuration consistent with macroscopic [[State Variable|state variables]] are equally probable. See the [[Ergodic Hypothesis]]. And so, all thermodynamic state variables of a given equilibrium state are given by an [[Ensemble Average]].

This choice is motivated by the identification that almost every phase space configuration is macroscopically indistinguishable, and that due to [[Energy Stability Conditions]] almost every state has the macroscopic properties of thermal equilibrium.

The microcanonical ensemble counts the number of states in a given energy range $E + \delta E$ with the [[Density of States]] $\Omega(E)$. This is the distribution that describes systems in an ensemble of fixed energy, particle number, and volume. 

The microcanonical ensemble is closely related to [[Entropy]]:
