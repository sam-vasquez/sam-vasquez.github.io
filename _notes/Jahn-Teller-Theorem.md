A polyatomic molecule with electron orbital degeneracy cannot be stable with respect to all displacements of the nuclei, unless the nuclei all lie on a straight line. Otherwise, energy minimization will favor perturbing the geometry slightly to split the orbital degeneracies.

Proof: [[(2009) The Permutational Proof of the Jahnâ€“Teller Theorem]]
Proof essentially uses properties of the point groups as subgroups of the symmetric group.
