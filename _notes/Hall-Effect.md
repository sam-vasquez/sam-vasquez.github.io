Consider electrons on a conducting strip in the $x-y$ plane. It has infinite length in the $x$ direction and width $w$ in the $y$ direction. Suppose the electronic current is flowing in the $x$ direction.
Apply a perpendicular magnetic field $B \hat{z}$.
For the current to flow in a straight line, the force from the magnetic field should be cancelled by the force from the gradient of the Hall voltage.
$$
\frac{e}{c} v B = \frac{V_H}{w},
$$
$v$ the electron's velocity. Since current is $I = n e v w$, $n$ the electron's density,
$$
R_H \equiv \frac{V_H}{I} = \frac{B}{nec}.
$$
This is the Hall resistance corresponding to the Hall voltage.
