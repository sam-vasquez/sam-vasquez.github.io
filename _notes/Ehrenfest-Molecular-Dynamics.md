Ehrenfest molecular dynamics attempts to study [[Non-Adiabatic Molecular Dynamics]] by allowing the nuclei to evolve semiclassically, through a classical Newtonian force generated by the expectation value of the electronic energy according to the [[Ehrenfest Theorem]]. In other words, classical trajectories evolve along the time-dependent mean-field PES. 




Being a mean field approximation, it naturally has several shortcomings:
Many physical processes involve nonadiabatic transitions between two or more Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces. Replacement of the delocalized quantum amplitude by its average value leads to nonphysical evolution along a fictitious mean PES, yielding incorrect solutions.


A number of corrections exist:
- [[Trajectory Surface Hopping]], which allows trajectories to make transitions among quantum states depending on the magnitude of the coupling strength.
	- Similar to surface hopping is the [[Quantum-Classical Liouville Dynamics]].
- [[Collapse-to-a-Block Corrected Ehrenfest Dynamics]].
- Bohm's quantum trajectory formulation, mapping each electronic state on a pair of action-angle variables, replacing discrete states with continuous degrees of freedom. See refs 15-20 in [[(2015) Quantum-classical path integral_ A rigorous approach to condensed phase dynamics]].
- [[Quantum-Classical Path Integral]], which removes the mean field approximation entirely by replacing the Schrodinger equation with the [[Path Integral Formalism]].
