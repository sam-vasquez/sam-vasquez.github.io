The issue with a quantum theory of gravity is that quantum mechanics and general relativity are not compatible with each other in straightforward ways. 
# Quantum Matter in Classical Gravity
The most obvious issue with coupling quantum matter to classical gravity is that QM has absolute time and spatial metric, whereas classical gravity has time included in a dynamical metric. To some extent, this can be resolved using the formalism of [[QFT in Curved Spacetime]]. However, there are often inconsistencies.
[[Semiclassical Gravity]]

A new no-go theorem has proven that coupling quantum matter to classical gravity requires abandoning the reversibility of processes. See [[Stochastic Quantum Coupling to Classical Gravity]].

# Gravity as a QFT
Formulating gravity as a quantum field theory is desirable, because it has been tremendously successful at describing all other known matter and interaction, and at large scales we already describe gravity with classical field theory. However, it is somewhat awkward to do this, since we think of gravity as explaining the origins and properties of spacetime itself, and we only know how to formulate QFTs on a given background. 

The earliest attempt to describe quantum gravity was to formulate gravity as a QFT of massless spin-2 fields propagating on flat spacetime, coupled universally to other matter and gauge fields. That is to say, to formulate gravity as gravitons. It does not work, this theory is not perturbatively renormalizable because Newton's coupling has negative mass dimension. 
See [[Massless Spin-2 Fields]] for construction and results of this theory.

### Using Gravitons Anyways

The theory of gravitons can be recovered in a couple of ways. 
##### Quantum Gravity as an EFT
The most popular idea is to consider it as an effective field theory, where
there is some cutoff scale, usually the Planck scale, beyond which gravity
behaves very differently. The EFT formalism can then still perform meaningful
calculations even without renormalization. 
See [[Graviton EFT]] for results of this theory.
Examples of calculations:
	[[(2002) Quantum Gravitational Corrections to the Nonrelativistic Scattering Potential of Two Masses]]
However, this is not a satisfying answer to what is the true nature of quantum gravity. Theories of gravity below the EFT scale include the following:

##### UV Completion via Asymptotic Safety
Gravity might be able to satisfy a stronger, non-perturbative notion of renormalization called Asymptotic Safety.
This condition is realized by an interacting fixed point of the RG flow,
allowing quantum gravity to become scale-invariant at low energies. It has yet to be proven that gravity has such a fixed point, and progress in this area is slow.
See [[Asymptotic Safety]] for a definition of this concept in general, and see [[Asymptotic Safety#Gravity]] for progress in the area of proving its validity for gravitons.

### Alternative QFT Structures

It might be necessary to abandon the idea of gravitons on flat spacetime. Quantum gravity understood using the QFT formalism could instead be described by a QFT on some sort of alternative background space.

##### Alternative Spacetime Dimension

##### Spacetime as a Lattice
A natural approach is that spacetime should be described by discrete variables; this automatically regularizes any gravitational theory. See Formulations of quantum gravity on discrete spacetime for examples.
