Corresponds to $\nu = 5/2$ in [[Quantum Hall Effect]]. See section 10.2 of reference.

Normalized using Pfaffian. Determined via CFT. Not describable using ordinary slater determinants obviously, since there's no natural second quantized operator description of collective phenomena.

Has to do with p + ip superconductor and conformal field theory. For CFT, see section 13.1 of reference.
