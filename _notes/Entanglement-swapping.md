Two particles that were not previously entangled can be made to become entangled via Bell measurement on their respective partner particles. This becomes analogous to [[Quantum State Teleportation]], where the entanglement between two particles is "teleported" to two other particles. This allows long-distance establishment of entanglement between distant nodes, if there are many entangled pairs shared along a path of nodes. Important for quantum communication.
