The affine group is the group of all invertible affine transformations of an [[Affine Space]] into itself.

The affine group can be decomposed as the [[Semidirect Product]] of $V$ by [[GL(N)|GL(V)]]:
$$
\textrm{Aff}(V) = V \rtimes GL(V).
$$
By construction of the semidirect product, the affine group has a $N+1$ dimensional representation
$$
\begin{pmatrix} 
M & v  \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
