Laplace's method is a method for approximating integrals of the form 
$$
\int dx \; f(x) e^{ \lambda g(x) },
$$
for $\lambda$ large and $g$ twice-differentiable with unique global maximum in the integration domain.

The idea is that for very large $\lambda$, the exponential is very strongly peaked at the maximum of $g$, and can be approximated with a Gaussian integral.
