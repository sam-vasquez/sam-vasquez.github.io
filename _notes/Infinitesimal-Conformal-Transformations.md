Much like the analysis of the [[Poincare Group#Infinitesimal Transformations|Poincare transformations]], we can understand the conformal transformations by considering the action of transformations infinitesimally close to the identity, parameterized by some small $\epsilon$. This gives us a definition of the vector fields on Minkowski space whose flow generates conformal transformations, as the vector fields $\epsilon^\mu$ that satisfy the [[Conformal Killing Equation]]. 

This equation has a finite number of solutions for spacetime manifolds with dimension greater than 3. See solutions [[Conformal Killing Vectors in d≥3|here]].

But in 2 spacetime dimensions, there are infinitely many solutions. See solutions [[Conformal Killing Vectors in d=2|here]].

These infinitesimal solutions implement the finite conformal transformations on Minkowski space according to their flow. See a derivation of the finite conformal transformations [[Finite Conformal Transformations (d≥3)|here]].
