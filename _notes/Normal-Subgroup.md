A normal subgroup is a subgroup $N$ of group $G$ such that $N$ is closed under [[Conjugation]] in $G$: for all $n \in N$, $g n g^{-1} \in N$ for all $g \in G$.

Normal subgroups are structurally stable in response to symmetries (inner automorphisms) of the group. 


Example: the matrix group [[SL(N)]] is a normal subgroup of [[GL(N)]]. For any matrix $X \in SL(N)$, $\det (AXA^{-1}) = \det(A)\det(X)\det(A)^{-1} = \det(X)$.
