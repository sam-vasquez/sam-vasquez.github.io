In higher spacetime dimensions, the conformal group is finite dimensional and has a structure not unlike the ordinary Poincare group with some additional transformations. We can actually find the Poincare generators present in the conformal Lie algebra.

We get the conformal group generators by finding the generators $G$ that implement the symmetry $x'^\mu = x^\mu + \epsilon^\mu$ (for $\epsilon^\mu$ a [[Conformal Killing Vectors in d≥3|conformal Killing vector]]) as a differential operator on a scalar field on spacetime, $f'(x') = e^{ i a \cdot G } f(x)$ for some characteristic parameter $a$. 
Doing this for the conformal Killing vectors in $d \geq 3$ gives us the [[Conformal Generators in d≥3|conformal group generators]].

The conformal group generators form the basis of the Conformal Lie algebra. The Lie algebra has [[Conformal Lie Algebra in d≥3|the following commutation relations]].

The conformal group for $d\geq3$ has a Lie algebra spanned by the $\frac{d(d+1)}{2}$ Poincare generators, $d$ special conformal generators, and $1$ dilatation generator, giving a total of $\frac{(d+2)(d+1)}{2}$ conformal generators. 
This is precisely the same dimension as an $SO(d+2)$ algebra. This is not at all a coincidence. See proof [[Conformal Algebra is Isomorphic to so(d,2)|here]].
