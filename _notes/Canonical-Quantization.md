"Dirac realized that quantization is just going from the Lie algebra ([[Geometric Hamiltonian Mechanics|as the functions on phase space]]) to a unitary representation of it, something that can be done uniquely (Stone-von Neumann) on the nose for the Lie subalgebra of polynomial functions of degree less than or equal to two, but only up to ordering ambiguities for higher degree."
