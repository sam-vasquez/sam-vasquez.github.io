It is said (DiVincenzo's criteria) that a good platform for quantum information processing (or even to build a full-fledged quantum computer), it must have the following characteristics:
- A scalable physical system with well-characterized qubits
- The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple fudicial state, eg $00\ldots0$.
- Long relaxation and dephasing times, much longer than the gate operation time. 
- A universal set of quantum gates. (An example is the three Pauli gates plus CNOT.)
- A qubit-specific measurement capability.
For quantum communication:
- The ability to interconvert stationary and flying qubits.
- The ability to faitthfully transmit flying qubits between specified locations.

Many commercial quantum computers have been emerging that fulfill the properties on this list. Candidate systems include superconducting qubits, solid-state spin qubits, [[Photonic Quantum Computing]], trapped ions, and topological qubits.
