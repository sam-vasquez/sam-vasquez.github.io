A notion of closeness between density matrices in quantum information.
Quantum analog of the Bhattacharyya distance in classical probability.
Neither of these are metrics.
Defines the Bures metric.
Identical to the Fubini-Study metric when restricted to pure states.
See Phy 568 Unit 10 for introductions to these measures.

Can be used to characterize quantum phase transitions. Related to [[Anderson's Orthogonality Catastrophe]].

Was used to analyze the Bose-Hubbard model, for example.

This seems a little underutilized in condensed theory atm, possibly because
