A phase diagram is usually a graph of pressure vs Temperature or pressure vs volume. 

Boundaries between phases is called a coexistence curve. Intersections of coexistence curves are called, for example, triple points. When a curve ends, called a critical point. (Technically a bicritical point, because two variables need to be fixed to reach the point. Sometimes there's even tricritical points.)

Example: Water.
Water is unique: permanent net electric dipole moment, due to non-colinear bonds. 
Melting temperature: 273.15 K
Triple point: 273.16 K, $6 \times 10^{-3}$ atm
Critical point: 647.3 K, 218 atm

Example: Argon
Argon is the largest noble gas in the atmosphere, easy to separate out.
Noble gasses have simple phase diagrams. 
Melting temperature: 83.81 K
Boiling temperature: 87.3 K
Triple point: 83.806 K, 69 kPa
Critical point: 150.39 K, 4.86 MPa
(1 atm = 0.1 MPa = 100 kPa)
Order parameter: density difference between phases.

Example: Neon
Another noble gas
Melting temperature: 24.56 K
Boiling temperature: 27.1 K
Also has very small temperature difference.

Example: CO2
Dry ice. Unlike water, has linear bonds, net neutral.
Ambient temperature is below triple point - with temperature, goes directly from gas to solid phase. Have to increase pressure to get liquid phase.
Why does dry ice feel wet? Water vapor in the air condensates on the surface.
Triple point: 5.1 atm
Critical point: 304 K, 7.38 MPa
Must raise pressure dramatically, but temperature not by much.

Example: Magnetic systems
Instead of pressure and temperature, typically look at isotherms in a magnetization vs external field diagram.
