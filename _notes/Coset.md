For any subgroup $H$ of $G$, the cosets of $H$ in $G$ are the sets obtained by either left- or right- multiplying $H$ by elements of $G$: $gH$ and $Hg$ respectively.

Cosets generated by different group elements $g$ are always disjoint or identical, since groups are connected by their product. Algebraically, if $x \in gH$, there must exist $h \in H$ such that $x = gh$. Thus $xH = (gh)H = g(hH) = gH$.

Cosets are one example of an equivalence class capable of partitioning the group, another example being [[Conjugation]]. Cosets are something like splitting a group apart using subgroups, while conjugation is more like mixing the group and separating it into distinct regions.

Cosets of a [[Normal Subgroup]] result in the [[Quotient Group]] $G/N$, as the group of all cosets with group operation defined by $(aN)*(bN) = abN$.
