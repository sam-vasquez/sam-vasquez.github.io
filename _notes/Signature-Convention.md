Frustratingly, the signature of the Minkowski metric is only defined up to convention. The two conventions are +--- and -+++. Or in general, that the timelike coordinates are positive vs negative, as opposed to the spacelike coordinates being negative vs positive.

The following depend on the choice of signature and should be looked out for:
Definition of the [[Gamma Matrices]] (but not their Lorentz-invariant identities.)

If a result is off by a minus sign, check whether flipping one of these works.
