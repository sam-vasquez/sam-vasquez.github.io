A phase transition is an abrupt change in the properties of a system, characterized by an [[Order Parameter]]. 

Phase transitions are visualized using [[Phase Diagrams]]. The transition will happen along some phase boundary in the $P-V$ or $P-T$ plane. Many thermodynamic quantities gain nonanalytic behavior at this boundary. This behavior typically depends on temperatures near some critical temperature $T_C$.

In a **first order phase transition**, a first derivative of the free energy fails to exist at $T_C$. There is a discontinuity in the volume occupied by the particles as a liquid transforms to a gas across the phase boundary.
