The kernel of a group homomorphism $\phi: G \rightarrow H$ is the inverse image of the identity in $H$ - for additive groups, this is the inverse image of 0. For multiplicative groups, the inverse image of 1.
$$
\ker \phi = \{g \in G : \phi(g) = e_H\}.
$$

Warning: the kernel of a linear transformation $V\rightarrow W$ is the vector subspace that is mapped to the zero vector in $W$, an *additive identity*. But the kernel of a *representation* of that linear transformation $GL(V) \rightarrow GL(N,F)$ is the identity matrix, a *multiplicative identity*.
