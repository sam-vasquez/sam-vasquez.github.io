In classical mechanics, the correlation of an observable $A(t')$ with its value at a time $t = t'' - t'$ later is defined via the [[Ensemble Average]] of its fluctuations, yielding the [[Correlation Function]]
$$
K(t) \equiv \langle A(t') A(t'') \rangle - \langle A \rangle^2 = \langle \delta A(t') \delta A(t'') \rangle = \langle \delta A(0) \delta A(t) \rangle.
$$
It is trivial to show that $K(t) = K(-t)$, and $K(0) = \langle (\delta A)^2 \rangle$.

Its Fourier transform is the [[Power Spectral Density]], according to the [[Wiener-Khinchin Theorem]].
