Staggered fermions are an approach to the [[Fermion Doubling]] problem putting chiral fermions in a lattice field theory. They preserve chiral symmetry on the lattice, and only result in 4 instead of 16 Dirac fermions.

In 3+1D, they are formally the discrete equivalent of [[Dirac-Kahler Fermions]].
