In classical mechanics, an ensemble is a probability distribution function over phase space. Its quantum mechanics counterpart is the [[Density Operator]].

In general, any ensemble corresponding to a conservative system satisfies [[Liouville's Theorem]].

In equilibrium statistical mechanics, examples include the [[Canonical Ensemble]]and [[Grand Canonical Ensemble]]. 

In [[Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics]], $f(r^N,p^N)$ is typically considered to be some driving force $F$.
