The quotient group $G/N$ is a group defined from the [[Coset]]s of a [[Normal Subgroup]] $N$ of group $G$. The elements are cosets $gN$, and the operation is $(gN)*(hN) = ghN$.

The quotient group essentially flattens out the normal subgroup, reducing the group structure to just a single indistinguishable representative of $N$ along with one for each of its adjacent cosets. Put another way, it uses coset classification to remove the redundancy of similarity transformations from $G$.
