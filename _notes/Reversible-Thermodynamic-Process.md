A *reversible process* is any process that takes equilibrium state $A$ to equilibrium state $B$ in such a way that the system is always in equilibrium for every infinitesimal time-step, and therefore can be taken back to $A$ with smooth variations in the state variables.

The process is a path on the manifold of equilibrium states, controlled by infinitesimal changes in the state variables, and in practice they need to be very slow processes. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] requires of [[Entropy]] that any adiabatic process that takes state $A$ to state $B$ can only be reversible if $\Delta S = 0$, giving a useful way to characterize reversibility. 

In the statistical picture, it also makes sense that entropy should be unchanged by reversible processes and increasing otherwise, since it should be a measure of statistical information entropy.
