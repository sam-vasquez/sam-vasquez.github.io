$$
\left( \frac{\delta Q}{\partial T} \right) = T \left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right) = C.
$$
Either volume or pressure held constant.

The constant volume heat capacity is conveniently expressed in terms of the [[Internal Energy (Mechanical System)]] as
$$
C_V = \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} \right)_V.
$$
It is also related to the energy fluctuations by
$$
\begin{align*}
\langle (\delta E)^2 \rangle &= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \beta^2} \ln Z\\
&= - \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial \beta}\\
&= - \frac{\partial T}{\partial \beta} \left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} \right)_V \\
&= -k_B T^2 C_V.
\end{align*}
$$

In thermodynamic equilibrium between two subsystems of a composite system, [[Energy Stability Conditions]] imply that heat capacity is positive.

It definitely makes sense that the [[Heat Capacity]] should be positive for sensible systems: increasing temperature should correlate with increasing heat, otherwise it would be the case that a cold reservoir in contact with a hot reservoir would only get colder and colder. But sometimes systems are not sensible, stars for example. They do have negative heat capacity in some sense, they radiate heat and get hotter.

Constant-pressure heat capacity is always greater than constant-volume heat capacity. Proof: see homework from week 2. Related to a similar inequality for [[Compressibility]].
