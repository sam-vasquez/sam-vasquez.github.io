Temperature is the defining state variable of thermal equilibrium between two systems, and a quantity that describes heat transfer by controlling the rate of entropy transfer.

As a quantity, temperature is [[Heat-Entropy Relation|defined]] from the [[Notes/First Law of Thermodynamics|first]] and [[Second Law of Thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics as $\delta Q = T dS$. 

The [[Thermodynamic Identity]] defined from the first law, and corresponding identities derived from [[Legendre Transformations]], provide the following equivalent expressions for $T$:
- $T = \left( \frac{\partial U(S,V,n)}{\partial S} \right)_{V,n}$
- $T = \left( \frac{\partial H(S,p,n)}{\partial S} \right)_{p,n}$, where $H$ is [[Enthalpy]].

The [[Maxwell Relations]] provide the following relations between derivatives of $T$ and derivatives of other variables:

Consider two systems that are connected in such a way that they can transfer heat but not work. Write $S = S(U,X_i) = S_1(U_1,X_1) + S_2(U_2,X_2)$.
It can be derived that heat transfer from 1 system to the other system implies that the temperature of one is greater than the other. Heat flows toward to colder temperature. It stops when $T$s are equal, when thermal equilibrium, to first order $\Delta S = 0$.
