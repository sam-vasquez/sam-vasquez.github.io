If equilibrium statistical mechanics is characterized by [[Reversible Thermodynamic Process|reversible thermodynamic processes]] and a [[Density Operator]] corresponding to the Boltzmann distribution, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is every other thermodynamic process that removes the state from the equilibrium state manifold.

It experiences many difficulties: For example, the [[Ergodic Hypothesis]] fails to hold, an out-of-equilibrium state is not equally likely as the equilibrium states, and therefore the [[Microcanonical Ensemble]] definition of [[Entropy]] is not well-defined.

For a formal treatment of out-of-equilibrium dynamics of classical observables, see [[Classical Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics]].
