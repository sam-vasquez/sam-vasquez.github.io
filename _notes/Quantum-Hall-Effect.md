The quantum Hall effect is the observation that in certain electron systems confined to 2 dimensions, the [[Hall Effect|Hall resistance]] is not linear, but instead plateaus at specific values of the magnetic field. The specific values of the magnetic field may vary, but the respective quantized values of the Hall resistance are universal.

Electrons confined to 2 dimensions by strong magnetic field has particular values where resistivity tensor diagonal components go to zero and off-diagonal components are constant up to a factor of an integer value $\nu$. When fractional, the [[Fractional Quantum Hall Effect]].

That value corresponds to the number of filled Landau levels.
