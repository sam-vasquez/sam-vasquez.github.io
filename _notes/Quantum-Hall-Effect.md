Electrons confined to 2 dimensions by strong magnetic field has particular values where resistivity tensor diagonal components go to zero and off-diagonal components are constant up to a factor of an integer value $\nu$. When fractional, the [[Fractional Quantum Hall Effect]].

That value corresponds to the number of filled Landau levels.
