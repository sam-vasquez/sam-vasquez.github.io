$k_B = 1.381 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K $= .862 \times 10^{-4}$ eV/K.

Typical ionic/covalent bond strength $\sim 100$ kcal/mol $= 4.35$ eV/molecule. 
Typical hydrogen bond strength $\sim 10$ kcal/mol $.435$ eV/molecule.
Makes phase transitions natural: iron melting happens on the order of 1000 K because that energy comes out to close to bond strength.
