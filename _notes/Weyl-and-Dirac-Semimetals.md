Dirac/Weyl semimetals are so-called because near their conduction-valence-band crossing (Dirac point), electrons behave as Dirac/Weyl fermions with linear dispersion and chirality. 

Some Dirac semimetals can support Weyl fermions due to broken symmetry splitting the Dirac point, see for example https://doi-org.proxy.library.stonybrook.edu/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013271 (at least as claimed by ref 3 in [[(2014) Observation of the Chiral magnetic effect in ZrTe5]]).

ZrTe5 is a notable such semimetal, noteworthy for displaying the [[Chiral Magnetic Effect]] and the anomalous hall effect ([[Quantum Hall Effect]]).
See [[(2022) Anomalous Hall effect at the Lifshitz transition in Zr‚Å¢Te5]] for example.
