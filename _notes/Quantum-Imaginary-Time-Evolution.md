[[(2020) Determining eigenstates and thermal states on a quantum computer using quantum imaginary time evolution]]



Its application to chiral dynamics simulation ([[(2022) Studying chirality imbalance with quantum algorithms]], [[(2024) Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation]]) might have insight from https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=14279.
