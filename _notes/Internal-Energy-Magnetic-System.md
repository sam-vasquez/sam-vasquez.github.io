Internal energy is a thermodynamic potential. For a magnetic system, it is
$$
dE = T dS + HdM + \sum_i \mu_i dN_i.
$$
In contrast to [[Internal Energy (Mechanical System)]], it increases due to work done by an external magnetic field.
Note: Chandler (Phy 540) uses $-MdH$, whereas Stanley (Phy 541) uses $+HdM$. Both are consistent with energy stability conditions, but $+HdM$ makes more sense in analogy with $-pdV$, where $H$ is an externally applied force that induces a change in internal property $M$. This distinction is carefully discussed in e.g. Kittel (1958), Guggenheim (1967). See Stanley 2.7 for more references.

Any equation involving the variables of mechanical systems can be translated to magnetic systems using substitutions $V \rightarrow M$, $p \rightarrow -H$.
