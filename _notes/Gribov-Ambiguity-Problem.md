Gauge fixing presents a complication in non-Abelian gauge theories: there are many gauges that aren't unique. Many gauge fixing conditions are specified as a differential equation of some sort. The solutions to this equation might not yield an unambiguous procedure for distinguishing gauge-equivalent solutions. The [[Faddeev-Popov Ghosts]] attempt to resolve this, but the formalism still assumes that for each physical configuration there exists exactly oneÂ gauge field that corresponds to it and that obeys the gauge condition. This is not necessarily the case in Yang Mills theory.

Good discussion of the differential geometry of gauge fixing. In what sense it means choosing a representative from gauge orbits, choosing sections of a fiber bundle.

This ambiguity problem is cited as a reason not to use differential gauge fixing conditions in Yang Mills theories, and instead use the [[Temporal Gauge]].
