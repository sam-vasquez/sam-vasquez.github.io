With action 
$$
S = \int \mathcal{L}\left[ q,\dot{q},t \right] dt,
$$
the stationary solutions are $q$ satisfying
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}} = 0.
$$

Notes:
When applying to a Lagrangian density of fields, treat $\psi^\dagger$ and $\psi$ as different fields and vary with respect to $\psi^\dagger$ to get equations of motion.
