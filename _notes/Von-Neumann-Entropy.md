The von Neumann entropy of a [[Density Operator]] $\rho$ is the measure of [[Entropy (Information Theory)|entropy]] associated with the mixing of pure states. It is defined as $S = -\textrm{Tr}(\rho\log \rho)$.

The von Neumann entropy is 0 only for pure states. Up to a factor of $k_B$, thermodynamic entropy is the von Neumann entropy of the [[Canonical Ensemble]].
