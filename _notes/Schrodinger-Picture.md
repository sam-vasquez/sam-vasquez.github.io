In the Schrodinger picture, quantum states evolve in time under the action of $e^{ -iHt }$, whereas operators are time-independent.

States evolve as
$$
i \partial_t \ket{ \psi, t }_S = H \ket{ \psi, t }_S.
$$
Density matrices evolve as
$$
i \partial_t \rho(t) = \left[ H, \rho(t) \right],
$$
which is sometimes referred to as the Liouville-von Neumann equation and written
$$
\partial_t \rho(t) = \mathcal{L}(t) \rho(t).
$$
