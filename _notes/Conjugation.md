Elements $a$ and $b$ of a group $G$ are conjugate to each other if there exists an element $g$ such that $b = g a g^{-1}$.

Conjugation is an equivalence relation on groups that partitions the group into different conjugacy classes, where each member of the same conjugacy class is indistinguishable from one another using only group multiplication. 

Elements $g_1$ that are invariant under conjugation by an element $g_i$ commute with each other. Elements $g$ that are invariant under conjugate / commute with *every* element of $G$ belong to the center of the group.
