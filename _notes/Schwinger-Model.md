The Schwinger model is a [[1+1D Spacetime|1+1 dimensional]] [[QED]] model, and a toy model for [[QCD]]. 

The Lagrangian is
$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_\mu{}_\nu F^\mu{}^\nu + \bar{\psi} (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - g \gamma^\mu A_\mu - m)\psi + \frac{g \theta}{4 \pi} \varepsilon^\mu{}^\nu F_\mu{}_\nu.
$$
It has a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, since it is just an extension of the usual QED with an additional background term. 

When written in the [[Gamma Matrices|Dirac basis]], the Hamiltonian has a form that lends itself well to discretization via [[Staggered Fermions]].

All solutions are constant electric fields, there are no propagating waves. A point charge emits a constant electric field, analogous to the constant electric field emitted by a uniform surface charge in 3+1D.

The $\theta$ term 
 


It has an [[Chiral Anomaly|anomalous axial current]].
It has a theta term.
It [[Confinement in Schwinger Model|exhibits confinement]]. 



Its simulation on quantum computers is the subject of [[(2024) Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation]] and [[(2022) Quantum simulation of chiral phase transitions]].
