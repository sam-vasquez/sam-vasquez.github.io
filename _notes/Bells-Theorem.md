Bell's theorem is a result that states that [[Hidden Variable Theory|hidden variable theories]] are incompatible with both local interactions and quantum mechanical measurements. (Or more appropriately, Bell-type theorems are a class of results that prove this incompatibility given various assumptions behind the nature of the measurements and interactions).

One proof comes from the [[CHSH Inequality]], which also provides a practical experimental method to detect this violation.

Another proof of local hidden variable violation comes from a contradiction from [[GHZ State Violation]].

See Kochen-Specker / Bell-KS theorem for additional constraints on non-local hidden-variable theories.
