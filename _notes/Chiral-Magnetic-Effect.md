A manifestation of the [[Chiral Anomaly]] as an electric current in response to an applied magnetic field.

First discovered at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at [[Brookhaven National Lab]].
([[(2021) Chiral magnetic effect reveals the topology of gauge fields in heavy-ion collisions]]). 

First predicted by [[Dmitri E. Kharzeev (SBU)]]  studying topological transitions in hot QCD matter. 
([[(2008) The Chiral Magnetic Effect]])


Chiral asymmetry is produced by parallel electric and magnetic fields in Weyl semi-metals or in quark gluon plasmas. Aside from heavy ion collisions, it has been discovered experimentally in the Dirac semi-metal ZrTe5 
([[(2014) Observation of the Chiral magnetic effect in ZrTe5]]). 

The chiral current is usually studied as being generated by a static magnetic field, but can also be generated in WSMs by circular polarized light. Also in DSMs if crystal inversion symmetry is first broken, transforming the DSM into a metastable WSM. 

Qiang Li used computational first-principles and effective Hamiltonian methods to show that lattice distortions can drive the DSM ZrTe5 from a topological insulator to a WSM by breaking global inversion symmetry.

This suggests a procedure for making chiral qubits, a good candidate for a topological qubit that is viable at room temperature.
