Isothermal compressibility:
$$
\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V} \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial p} \right)_T.
$$
Constrained positive by [[Energy Stability Conditions|stability of free energy]]: putting pressure on something makes it smaller. At least when classical thermodynamics is valid.

Water: volume decreases with temperature.
