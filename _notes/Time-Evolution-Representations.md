There are three different, yet physically equivalent, representations of the time evolution of quantum states and operators under the Hamiltonian:

In the [[Schrodinger Picture]], quantum states evolve in time and operators are time-independent.

In the [[Heisenberg Picture]], quantum states are time-independent and operators evolve in time.

In the [[Interaction Picture]], both states and operators evolve in time, but the action of the Hamiltonian on these objects is split between a free Hamiltonian term and an interaction term. When the Hamiltonian is written as $H = \bar{H} + V$, $\bar{H}$ a free Hamiltonian and $V$ an interaction term, states evolve in time according to $\bar{H}$ and operators evolve according to $V$.
