Entanglement entropy is, as the name suggests, a measure of the degree of entanglement between two subsystems of a composite quantum system. 

Consider two quantum systems $A$ and $B$, each with their own set of quantum
states $\ket{ a_i }$ and $\ket{ b_j }$. The composite system can in general be
in a quantum state 
$$ 
\ket{ \Psi_{AB} } = \sum_{i,j}\; c_{ij} \ket{ a_i }
\otimes \ket{ b_j }. 
$$
