Also known as a principal homogeneous space, a $G$-torsor is a set $S$ equipped with a [[Group Action]] $\cdot$ of $G$, such that for any two elements $s, s' \in S$, there exists a *unique* group element $g \in G$ such that $s' = g \cdot s$.

Torsors often manifest as choices of arbitrary convention, where the ratio of two values matters but not the values themselves. The ratios are group elements, the values themselves are torsor elements. 

It's worth noting that although you can define the ratio $s/s' \equiv g$ and divide torsor elements, you cannot define multiplication $ss'$ of torsor elements.

It's said that a torsor is like a group that has forgotten its identity. Indeed, any group $G$ is itself a $G$-torsor, just by picking a new identity. And every $G$-torsor $S$ is isomorphic to $G$, just by picking any element in $S$ to be the identity.

Strongly related to [[Gauge Theory]].
