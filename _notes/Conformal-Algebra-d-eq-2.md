In $d=2$ dimensions, the [[Conformal Killing Equation|conformal Killing equation]] has an additional infinite set of solutions in the form of holomorphic functions, leading to [[Conformal Killing Vectors in d=2|infinitely many additional infinitesimal conformal transformations]]. This additional structure defines the so-called Witt algebra.

##### Lie Algebra Isomorphism

Although the conformal group in $d=2$ dimensions is infinite dimensional, there is a finite subgroup with generators that correspond directly to those of the $d\geq3$ generators. Therefore this subgroup is in turn isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C}) \cong \mathfrak{so}(3,1)$, reproducing the isomorphism from [[Conformal Algebra is Isomorphic to so(d,2)]].

> [!thm] The Global Conformal Group
> Restricting the [[#^3ecdfe|Witt algebra]] to $n=-1,0,1$ gives a finite subalgebra that is isomorphic to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ and by extension $\mathfrak{so}(3,1)$.
