A character of a group $G$ is a group homomorphism $\chi$ from $G$ to the multiplicative group of the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}^\times$. Sometimes also called the multiplicative character, or linear character.

The set of all such morphisms forms an Abelian group under multiplication. This is called the character group. 

The multiplicative character is a special case of the [[Character (Representation Theory)|representation-theoretic character]]: the homomorphism $\chi$ is a one-dimensional representation of $G$.
