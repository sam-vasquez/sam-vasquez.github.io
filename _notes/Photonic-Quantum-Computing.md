Photons as a [[Quantum Information Systems| quantum information system]] has advantages and disadvantages. 

Photonic systems are highly flexible. There are polarization degrees of freedom, continuous-variable coherent states (see [here](https://news.yale.edu/2020/08/12/yale-quantum-researchers-create-error-correcting-cat)).

Advantage: Clean, low decoherence.
Disadvantage: Hard to entangle.
