When trying to place fermions on a discrete lattice, the [[Nielsen-Ninomiya Theorem]] says that if we want to keep chirality, we have to deal with extra copies of fermions. 

Mathematically, the extra fermions appear in the non-trivial poles of the propagator.

In the naive lattice implementation of the Lagrangian, the [[Chiral Anomaly]] is absent, and the lattice essentially creates these extra fermions to cancel the anomaly in the continuum limit.

[[Staggered Fermions]] are a partial solution to this problem. They reduce the number of degrees of freedom, but you're still left with some extra degrees of freedom, "tastes". They're actually formally different from ordinary Dirac fermions, but can still be treated as basically the same.
