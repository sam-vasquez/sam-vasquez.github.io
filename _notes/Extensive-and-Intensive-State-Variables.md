An extensive [[State Variable]] is a variable that scales when you divide or add an identical system and look at the total value. Intensive state variables do not scale. For example, mass is extensive: two systems with mass $M_1$ and $M_2$ have total mass $M_1 + M_2$.

Formally, extensive variables are homogeneous in their extensive arguments with degree 1:
$$
U(\lambda S, \lambda V, \lambda N,\ldots) = \lambda U(S,V,N,\ldots).
$$
