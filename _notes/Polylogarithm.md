The polylogarithm is a special function that comes up frequently in derivations involving the [[Ideal Bose Gas]]. It is also sometimes called the **Bose-Einstein Function**.

It is defined as 
$$
g_\nu(z) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\nu)} \int_0^\infty dx \frac{x^{\nu-1}}{z^{-1}e^x - 1} = \sum_n \frac{z^n}{n^\nu},
$$
where $\Gamma(\nu)$ is the [[Gamma function]].

When $z = 1$, the polylogarithm reduces to the [[Riemann-Zeta function]]: $g_\nu(1) = \zeta(\nu)$.
