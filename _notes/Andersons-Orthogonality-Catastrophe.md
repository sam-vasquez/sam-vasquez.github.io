When a magnetic impurity is introduced into a metal, the conduction electrons will tend to screen the potential $V(r)$ that the impurity creates. The $N$-electron ground state for the system when $V(r) = 0$, corresponding to the absensce of the impurity, and when $V(r) \neq 0$, corresponding to the introduction of the impurity, are orthogonal in the thermodynamic limit.
