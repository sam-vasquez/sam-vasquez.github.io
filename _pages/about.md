Welcome! I am a recent graduate from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in
Physics. As a physicist, I am interested in the intersection of computational
and theoretical physics. I am seeking employment in a career where I can apply
these skills. 

This website serves as a repository for my projects and writing. You can learn
about my previous research activities at my [research page](/research/), and
you can find my resume [here](/cv/). My [portfolio page](/projects/) showcases
some of my personal programming projects, which I will be updating regularly as
I undertake new projects. I will be writing notes on physics content and
uploading them to my [writing page](/writing/); you can find my current reading
plans [here](/blog/TODO).
