I am a M.A. student of Physics at Stony Brook University. I graduated from
Carnegie Mellon University in May 2023 with a B.S. in Physics. I am interested
in quantum information theory and its application to many-body quantum
simulation.

I have recently joined [Benjamin Levine](https://levinegroup.org)'s
computational chemistry group, additionally collaborating with [Thomas
Weinacht](https://ultrafast.physics.sunysb.edu), for Master's thesis research
in molecular physics theory and simulation. At CMU, I worked with [Diana
Parno](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/parno.html) on simulation
design for collider neutrinos, and with [Riccardo
Penco](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/penco.html) on double copy
theory in classical gravity. More details on these research activities are
given [here](/research). 

I have taught the following subjects:
- F22: CMU Physics Department Tutoring - 3rd Year Core Classes
- F21: CMU Physics 141 Teaching Assistant - 1st Year Mechanics 

My coursework has largely focused on computational physics. Some projects are
located at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/sam-vasquez), with some
details at my [projects page](/projects/).

I have spent the last year digitizing my notes on various physics topics using
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I have published some of these notes
[here](/writing/), but it is much better viewed within Obsidian - my entire
vault is located [here](https://github.com/sam-vasquez/Physics-Obsidian-Vault),
with the exception of course-related materials and other private notes. For
now, they are mostly only written for my own reference, but even so, I hope
that others may somehow find them useful.
