I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in May
2023 with a B.S. in Physics. I have been taking
classes at Stony Brook University since August
2024, in preparation for a degree in quantum
information science.

At CMU, I concentrated on computational methods
for physics research. I worked with [Diana
Parno](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/parno.html)
on simulation design for collider neutrinos, and I
worked with [Riccardo
Penco](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/penco.html)
on double copy theory in classical gravity. More
details on these research activities are given
[here](/research). 

I have taught the following subjects:
- F22: CMU Physics Department Tutoring - 3rd Year Core Classes
- F21: CMU Physics 141 Teaching Assistant - 1st Year Mechanics 

My coursework in computational physics included several programming
projects. I have continued to maintain and expand on these projects to
incorporate self-taught techniques in machine learning and optimization. 
Details can be found at my [projects
page](/projects/), and the code can be found at [my GitHub
account](https://github.com/sam-vasquez).

As of this year I have been digitizing my notes on
various physics topics using 
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I have published
some of these notes [here](/writing/). I cannot
publish the entire vault due to containing
coursework, the conversion to github pages leaves
a lot to be desired, and the notes were only
intended for my own reference.
Still, I hope
that other students may somehow find them useful.
