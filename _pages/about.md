I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2023 with a B.S. in Physics.
I am interested in a career at the intersection of computation and theoretical
physics. 

I am broadly interested in the study of many-body systems and quantum fields
through computational models implemented on HPC systems.

At CMU, I concentrated on computational methods for physics research. I worked
with [Diana Parno](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/parno.html) on
simulation design for collider neutrinos, and I worked with [Riccardo
Penco](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/penco.html) on double copy
theory in classical gravity. More details on these research activities are
given [here](/research). 

I take joy in teaching fundamental physics and sharing my passion for the
subject with students. I have taught the following:
- F22: CMU Physics Department Tutoring - 3rd Year Core Classes
- F21: CMU Physics 141 Teaching Assistant - 1st Year Mechanics 

I am also a tutor on Wyzant. 

My coursework in computational physics led me to develop a few programming
projects. I have continued to maintain and expand on these projects to
incorporate self-taught techniques in machine learning and optimization for
applications in theoretical physics. Details can be found at my [projects
page](/projects/), and the code can be found at [my GitHub
account](https://github.com/sam-vasquez).

I have been writing notes on physics topics, mostly relating to numerical
optimization methods in conformal field theories and machine learning methods
in quantum many-body physics. These notes can be found [here](/writing/). The
notes are mainly for my own learning and reference, but I hope it's possible
that other students may find them useful.
