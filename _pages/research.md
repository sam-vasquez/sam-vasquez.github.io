In Spring 2025 I started work in Dr. Benjamin Levine's computational chemistry
group, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Weinacht from molecular and optical
physics. Work is still early in progress and subject to change - tentatively,
the goal of the project might be to develop an improved computational model
describing multiphoton absorption, to study coherent control in molecules and
simulations of molecular orbital decoherence.

In Fall 2022 I worked with Dr. Riccardo Penco on an investigation of the
classical double copy. We studied a particular matter distribution
corresponding to the far field limit of a monopole configuration of the global
O(3) scalar field theory, and found that despite its nontrivial matter content
it corresponds to a trivial background with no electromagnetic field content.
This led us to study the general behavior of the double copy with respect to
pure gauge fields and flat spacetimes. A writeup
of the research can be downloaded here (TODO).

In Summer 2021 I worked in Dr. Diana Parno's neutrino physics group in
collaboration with the COHERENT experiment. I upgraded a simulation of SNS
operation to support processing radioactivity events. Using this modified
simulation I studied the contribution of radioactive decay chains to neutrino
production in the facility at energy scales relevant for CEvNS studies. I
presented a poster at the 2021 APS Division for Nuclear Physics Conference, it
can be downloaded [here](/files/pdf/ParnoPoster.pdf).
