In Summer 2021 I worked in Dr. Diana Parno's neutrino physics group in
collaboration with the COHERENT experiment. I upgraded a simulation of SNS
operation to support processing radioactivity events. Using this modification I
studied the contribution of radioactive decay chains to neutrino production in
the facility at energy scales relevant for CEvNS studies. I presented a poster
at the 2021 APS Division for Nuclear Physics Conference, you can download it
[here](/files/pdf/ParnoPoster.pdf).

In Fall 2022 I started work with Dr. Riccardo Penco on a theoretical study of
the classical double copy. We studied a particular non-trivial matter
distribution corresponding to the far field limit of a monopole configuration
of the global O(3) scalar field theory, and found that despite [] it
corresponds to a trivial background with no electromagnetic field content.
Resolving this apparent paradox prompted us to study the general behavior of
the double copy with respect to pure gauge fields and flat spacetimes. We made
an argument that the 


and to understand the particular matter field as the far field limit of a
monopole configuration of global O(3) scalar fields coupled to gravity by
perturbatively analyzing higher order corrections to its configuration. Work is
still ongoing and is expected to finish by June 2023.
