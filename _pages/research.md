In Summer 2021 I worked in Dr. Diana Parno's neutrino physics group in
collaboration with the COHERENT experiment. I upgraded a simulation of SNS
operation to support processing radioactivity events. Using this modified
simulation I studied the contribution of radioactive decay chains to neutrino
production in the facility at energy scales relevant for CEvNS studies. I
presented a poster at the 2021 APS Division for Nuclear Physics Conference, you
can download it [here](/files/pdf/ParnoPoster.pdf).

In Fall 2022 I worked with Dr. Riccardo Penco on an investigation of the
classical double copy. We studied a particular matter distribution
corresponding to the far field limit of a monopole configuration of the global
O(3) scalar field theory, and found that despite its nontrivial matter content
it corresponds to a trivial background with no electromagnetic field content.
This led us to study the general behavior of the double copy with respect to
pure gauge fields and flat spacetimes. A writeup
of the research can be downloaded here (TODO).
