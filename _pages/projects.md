## Machine Learning Notebooks 
A collection of Jupyter notebooks to follow along with the review paper [A
High-bias, Low-variance Introduction to Machine Learning for
Physicists](https://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/MLnotebooks.html).  Some
inspiration is also taken from the tutorials for Perimeter Institute's 2023
course [Machine Learning for Many-Body Physics](https://pirsa.org/c23011).
