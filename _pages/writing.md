## Research Notes
This document summarizes my contributions to the double copy research detailed at this page.

## MPL Papers

These papers were written by myself as part of assigned laboratory work for the advanced laboratory physics course at CMU. It's important to clarify that these are not peer-reviewed publications nor do they contain original physics research. They are only meant to highlight my skills in carrying out standard lab procedures and communicating scientific findings in an academic style.

## Coursework Notes
This is a collection of notes I have taken while learning physics. They may or may not be a good reference for others to learn from.
