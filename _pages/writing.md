## Research Notes
This document summarizes my contributions to the double copy research detailed at this page.

## Physics Lab Reports
These papers were written as part of assigned laboratory work for the advanced laboratory physics course at CMU. These experiments are only original insofar as I was the one who carried them out to reproduce known results.

[Lab 1: Dynamic Light Scattering](/files/pdf/Light_Scattering.pdf)

[Lab 2: Cosmic Ray Muon Detection](/files/pdf/Cosmic_Ray_Muons.pdf)

[Lab 3: Raman Spectroscopy](/files/pdf/Raman_Spectroscopy.pdf)

## Coursework Notes
This is a collection of notes I have taken while learning physics. They are mainly for my own reference, but it's possible that others could find them useful.

[Index](/notes/)

They are uploaded here for convenience of reference, but they were originally written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It would be more natural to view these notes and their connections through an Obsidian vault. A copy of my Obsidian vault can be found [here](https://github.com/sam-vasquez/Physics-Obsidian-Vault).
